# Heart Failure Classification

Heart failure is a critical condition that affects millions of individuals worldwide, causing significant morbidity and mortality rates. Early prediction and accurate diagnosis of heart failure play a crucial role in providing timely interventions and improving patient outcomes. With advancements in machine learning techniques, the development of predictive models has gained significant attention in the medical field.

To effectively predict heart failure using the Heart Failure Prediction dataset, a single classifier may not provide the desired accuracy and robustness. This is where ensemble learning comes into play. Ensemble learning combines multiple individual classifiers to create a stronger, more reliable predictive model. By leveraging the diversity of these individual classifiers and their collective decision-making, ensemble models can often outperform single models and provide more accurate predictions. This project develop a classification model using an ensemble learning approach on the Heart Failure Prediction dataset from Kaggle.

The ultimate goal of this project is to contribute to the development of an accurate and reliable heart failure prediction model that can assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions and providing appropriate care to individuals at risk.
